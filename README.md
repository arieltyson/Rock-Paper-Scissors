# Rock-Paper-Scissors

As an aspiring developer, i channel my passion for software development through my real life interests. 
I play rock-paper-scissors everuday, be it for fun or religiously.
I created this program as a fun way to test the random capabilities of the software system to allow a user to test its luck against the computer (Antagonist).

In this project i used basic html to set up a front end interface for the project, coded in javascropt and styled with css.
