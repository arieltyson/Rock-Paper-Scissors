# Rock-Paper-Scissors
In this project, I created a web-based rock paper scissors game using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. The game will be played by the user against the computer. The user will select their move by clicking on a button for rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer's move will be randomly generated. The winner of each round will be determined based on the rules of rock paper scissors (rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock).
